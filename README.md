## How to run
0. Check out the code
1. Prepare MongoDB for local execution or modify app/controllers/MongoFactory object values
2. sbt run

## Solution
It consists of multiple examples that are easily found on playframework Tutorial site.

## Tests
No tests are provided as code does not have any custom logic.
It either works or it does not.

## Enhancements
All that could be enhanced is heavily dependent on customer.
If she wants MongoDB to be parametrised, it will be.
Additional CSS? Ok.
